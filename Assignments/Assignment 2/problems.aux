\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.4}(2) (10 pts). Prove that the convexity is preserved under a linear transformation. Supposed $f(w)$ is convex in terms of $w$. Prove that $g(w)=f(X w + b)$ is also convex in terms of $w$ where $X$ is a fixed matrix of appropriate size, and $b$ is a fixed vector of appropriate size. (So $X$ and $b$ are not variables in $g$). (Hint: you can simply use the definition of convex function)}{8}{}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.5}(3) (10 pts). From (1) and (2), prove the “loss” function $||y-Xw||_2$ is convex in terms of $w$ where $X_{n \times d}$ is a data matrix containing $n$ examples and each example has $d$ features, and $y$ is a column vector of length $d$. This dataset has been observed and thus fixed, and $w$ is the only variable in the norm.}{8}{}\protected@file@percent }
