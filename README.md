# CSE-5819-Intor-to-ML
Code for my CSE 5819 Intro to ML class at UConn for my PhD in CS.

**Course Description:** This course offers an introduction to the basic concepts and techniques of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning tasks and models, related optimization techniques, and methods for model validation and data preparation. Topics may include linear and logistic regression, regularization, support vector machines, neural networks, clustering, dimension reduction, as well as the gradient descent optimization algorithm. The materials covered in this course may vary slightly across different semesters. The course consists of lectures, programming-based and non-programming homework assignments, and exams. Lectures will serve as the vehicle for the instructor to introduce concepts and knowledge to students. Exams are used to test if basic concepts have been mastered. Programming-based assignments will be used for students to get profound hands-on experience by programming or experimenting with certain machine learning algorithms. This Fall2024 semester will be designed to test if ChatGPT can help pave individualized learning path for students.
